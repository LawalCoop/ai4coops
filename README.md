# AI4Coops

AI4Coops is an innovative project created in collaboration between some technology cooperatives from Argentina. Our goal is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop solutions for real challenges faced by cooperatives, enhancing their work, reach, and impact. We are committed to fostering technological innovation with a strong social consciousness, grounded in cooperative values.

We believe in the transformative potential of AI when used responsibly, with a focus on fairness, equity, and mutual support.

By joining forces, we aim to create tools and resources that promote collaboration, sustainability, and community-based growth.

### Our Mission
