      "keyPoint1Description": "We create custom AI tools that adapt to your cooperative’s needs. Whether it’s automating repetitive tasks or improving decision-making, our goal is to make your work easier and more efficient.",
      "keyPoint2Description": "Our solutions are designed to work alongside your team, not replace them. We focus on creating tools that help people do their jobs better, faster, and with less stress.",
      "keyPoint3Description": "We believe in the power of working together. By sharing knowledge and tools, we help cooperatives build stronger networks and achieve more as a community.",
      "main_text": "As technological cooperatives, we develop artificial intelligence solutions tailored to the needs of cooperatives. We work closely with each cooperative to understand their unique processes, challenges, and goals. By observing and analyzing how they operate, we co-create custom AI solutions that fit their needs. Together, we identify opportunities to enhance workflows, improve efficiency, and empower workers with technology to solve real-world problems and strengthen communities."

We engage with the team, observe workflows, and identify key challenges. We focus on finding bottlenecks like inefficiencies, high costs, or repetitive tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose AI-driven solutions to address these issues.",

      "phase3_text": "In this phase, we take the validated solution and refine it for full-scale implementation. This includes integrating it into your day-to-day operations, testing it in a live environment, and analyzing its impact by comparing performance metrics before and after implementation. Based on the results, we plan next steps to address additional challenges.",

      "title": "Who we are",
      "subtitle": "After more than 10 years of working in technology and cooperativism, we decided to come together to combine our strengths, knowledge, and experience. We’ve seen how cooperatives, despite their potential, often fall behind in adopting new technologies. That’s why we’ve come together as a network of tech cooperatives—to bridge that gap. As cooperatives ourselves, we understand the challenges cooperatives face because, in many ways, we speak the same language. We believe in the power of teamwork and interdisciplinary collaboration, and we’re committed to making a difference by developing technology that truly serves cooperatives. Our focus is on democratizing artificial intelligence, making it accessible and a driver of sustainable growth for cooperatives. If you’re a tech cooperative working with AI and would like to join us, we’d love to hear from you!",

        "description": "It allows machines to interpret images or videos. We use this technology to automate tasks like quality control (e.g., identifying defects in products), object recognition (e.g., sorting items in a warehouse), and security monitoring (e.g., detecting anomalies in real-time). It’s ideal for cooperatives that handle visual data and need to streamline processes."

For cooperatives, this means forecasting demand (e.g., predicting how much of a product will be needed), optimizing resources (e.g., planning inventory or workforce), and reducing risks (e.g., anticipating market changes). It’s a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions."

        "description": "Large language models can understand and generate human-like text. We use them to improve customer service (e.g., chatbots that answer questions instantly), automate document processing (e.g., extracting key information from contracts), and assist with content creation (e.g., generating reports or summaries). It’s perfect for cooperatives that deal with large volumes of text."

        "description": "Big data tools help manage and analyze large datasets that are too complex for traditional methods. For cooperatives, this means identifying trends (e.g., understanding customer behavior), optimizing operations (e.g., finding inefficiencies in workflows), and making strategic decisions (e.g., based on real-time data). It’s essential for cooperatives that generate or rely on large amounts of data."
